    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <p>This website was created independently by a group of engineering students. During our own academic journey, we realized how challenging it is to easily find essential study aids like past exam papers, notes, and reference materials all in one place. So it is to try to help the students find question papers notes and other materials easily all arranged in one place, you can download and refer the materials as you wish.</p>
